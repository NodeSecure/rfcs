ðŸ’¬ Exchange and discuss the future of NodeSecure.

## What for?

This repository is for discussing new project ideas to be added within the organization. It can also be used to discuss major API changes.

## Rules

There are currently no predefined rules for new ideas (we will probably work on that eventually).

However, if we decide to implement an idea we need at least one to two champions that will lead the subject. This means that we will not launch a new idea without having a champion to carry out.

### Champion

A champion is someone who leads the realization of an idea or a project. A Champion will most likely have the opportunity to become the maintainer of its project or tool created.

> **Note**: Being a champion is a great way to be elected core contributor.
>
> Examples of past ideas that current core team members have implemented:
> - [authors](https://github.com/NodeSecure/authors) by Vincent DHENNIN
> - [preview](https://github.com/NodeSecure/preview) by Tony GOREZ
> - [ci](https://github.com/NodeSecure/ci) by Antoine COULON
